# [Project 1: Machine Learning Classification Using Logistic Regression and KNN Method](https://github.com/mirfanbaihaqi/ML_Classification_LogReg_KNN)
There are several important step that you have to do until you get the result.

* Input Libraries
* Load the data
* Data understanding
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data cleaning
* Data preprocessing
* Data partition
* Modelling
* Evaluation Model

These are the result of both models that i used to predict the dataset.

# [Project 2: Data Preprocessing](https://github.com/mirfanbaihaqi/Data_Preprocessing) 
For this data preprocessing project, I took data from Telkom named telco. Data preprocessing is an important step before move to modelling using Machine Learning or Deep Learning. If the model that has been created produces less effective results, Data Scientist will return to preprocessing data. Because preprocessing data greatly affects the results of the effectiveness of the model later. Common case in data preprocessing is handling missing values, outliers and inconsistent data content.

Dividing the data into 80% training data and 20% testing data is very important. Because more and more training data is used, it will produce a good model. In addition, the model must also match or fit with the existing case.

This dataset has imbalance output. Its shown that 4136 are not churn and 1498 are churn. To handle this case, i use SMOTE so the data will turn into balance data. By using minority class to oversampling the data, i got the balance data now.

# [Project 3: Visualization Netflix Dataset](https://github.com/mirfanbaihaqi/Visualization_NetflixDataset)
This is some of my visualization using Netflix dataset. There are several visualization that i made.
* The Most Countries Contributor on Netflix
* Top 10 Director Based on The Number of Titles
* Rating Content Netflix
* Total Films in Each Year
* The Most Favorite Genre on Netlix
* Top Actor TV Shows Based on Number of Title
